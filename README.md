## Usage

Import the package in your controller and send request with required parameters.

```php
use SachinSanchania\Eazypay\Eazypay;

class PaymentController extends Controller
{ 
    public function payment()
    {
        $amount        = 1000;
        $referenceNo   = 1; // Stands for order ID or any related database identifier
        $optionalField = '10|10|10|10'; // Optional, must be in pipe (`|`) delimiter format as per ICICI's documentation

        $eazypay    = new Eazypay();
        $paymentUrl = $eazypay->getPaymentUrl($amount, $referenceNo, $optionalField);

        return redirect()->to($paymentUrl); // Redirects the user to ICICI Eazypay payment gateway
    }
}
```

After payment completion, ICICI will redirect the user to the return URL. You can capture the response like this:

```shell
public function paymentResponse(Request $request)
{
    $response = $request->all();

    // Validate and process payment response
    if (isset($response['status']) && $response['status'] == 'success') {
        // Payment successful, update order status
    } else {
        // Payment failed or pending, handle accordingly
    }

    return view('payment.status', compact('response'));
}

```
